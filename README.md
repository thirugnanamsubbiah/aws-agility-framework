Intuit AWS Agility Framework
============================

What is it?
-----------

The Intuit AWS Agility Framework (AAF) is a colleciton of templates, configuraiton management recipes and tools which have been tightly integrated to allow an engineer to rapidly provision RHEL instances into an AWS account.  

This includes:

* Cloud Formation Templates
* Chef Cookbooks and Starter Repo

Cloud Formation Templates
-------------------------

The easiest way to get started is to build a Cloud Formation Stack from one of our templates.  The AAF Cloud Formation Templates Repo provide templates to create common application stacks within AWS.

Chef Cookbooks and Starter Repo
-----------------------------

Want to install Java or Ruby?  The AAF cookbooks contain recipes for many of the common applications.  These cookbooks are integrated into the Cloud Formation templates or can be used in isolation.
